portergos persistent

Advantages

Save data
Download
Install packages

Uses less space than installed system
    iso requires around 2.5GB
    Installed system requires 8GB

Less writings to flash drive (less cicles=longer life to flash drive)

Syslinux boots both EFI and Legacy Mode

Can boot with persistence or live version (persistent files accessible to live version)

Can be transfered to smaller USB drives (2.5 minimum) to bigger one and running /portergos/persistent_portergos to readjust the size (loose data from the readjusted drive)

Disadvantages

Not sure how full system upgrades would make the system unstable (specially concerning write/rewrite cicles - not tested)
Needs a dedicated drive (needs to be installed to a drive, NOT a partition)
